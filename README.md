//                                          HOW TO START
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 
There are MANY ways to import the project to your machine - but the most direct line is to take Shane's 
approach:
- go to https://github.com/Maison-A/GCRBA
- ensure you're under the "<>code" tab
- down one row - to the right side (left of "about") there's a big green button
- click that button, and in the drop-down click "open with visual studio"

//                                         HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 
- now that you're in the IDE (the project SHOULD have loaded), you should be able to commit changes to a 
"stash" as frequently as you'd like.
    > this "stash" is basically a way to save the work you want uploaded before actually uploading
    > it's a way to ensure you're uploads are what you want them to be
- Once you're happy with the changes you've made you can either stash them, or outright commit
- Regardless, to actually push the changes to the GIT you'll need to commit and "push"
      > The menu should be available in your IDE automatically - if the menu is not simply go to "view" in the
      toolbar and click "git changes" (this is for VS 2019)
- You **MUST** enter a brief description of what you've changed/added/subtracted to the files/project
- you can then click under the dropdown and hit "commit all and push"
- Your changes will then be commited to the main branch of the project if you've selected the main branch and
didn't create a new one


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 
//                                          BRANCHES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
- Branches are - from what i can tell - off shoots of changes as to not conflict with any changes to the 
main project.
- You can create as many as youd like but they will never reach the main project - so keep that in mind
when pushing your commits
- I don't know much about them (for now) but yeah - if you're in doubt, branch it out.



// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 
//                                          MERGES AND CONFLICTS  
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
- GIT will not allow two lines of the same page of code to conflict. Meaning, if dev A changed line
56 and pushed, while dev B did the exact same, the GIT will not know which to override, and will throw
an error that will require a developer to resolve. This isnt TOO much of an issue but just thought i'd 
put that out there.

- that's all i've got for now, the readme is subject to change so I will be sure to notify all if and when
that happens


all the way
